# PyNukez

**Persistent storage for AI agents. Store anything, receive a cryptographic receipt, and confirm payment with the transaction signature from your own wallet, CLI, or signing workflow. PyNukez never executes transfers or takes custody of keys.**

```bash
pip install pynukez
```

Native support for both Solana and Monad blockchains. Thus, this includes support for Ed25519 and secp256k1 keypairs. The entire PyNukez library is designed and built for direct integration with agentic systems. The landmark agentic storage protocol is optimized for use by autonomous agents. Compatible with any model provider, agentic platform, or other integrations.

Requires Python 3.9+.

## How it works

1. `request_storage()` asks the gateway for a quote. You receive payment instructions — address, amount, asset, chain.
2. **You execute the transfer with your own wallet, CLI, hardware signer, or signing workflow.** PyNukez never touches funds or custody keys.
3. `confirm_storage(pay_req_id, tx_sig=<your_tx_sig>)` closes the loop and returns a receipt.
4. Use the receipt to provision a locker and upload / download / verify files.

The PyNukez SDK does not execute blockchain payments. That boundary is intentional: payment keys stay in the wallet, CLI, signer, or custody system you choose. Please visit https://nukez.xyz/docs/pynukez/helpers for examples and external helpers to facilitate cryptographic operations for agentic workflows.

## 30-Second Example

```python
import webbrowser
from pathlib import Path
from pynukez import Nukez

# Instantiate an instance of the Nukez class.
# keypair_path is one supported signer source. Use it when you want PyNukez
# to sign protected gateway envelopes with a local Solana keypair.
# Omit it only when providing signing_key or evm_private_key_path instead.
client = Nukez(
    keypair_path="~/.config/solana/id.json",  # local Ed25519 envelope signer
)

# Request the x402 payment instructions from the Nukez gateway.
# Pass the preferred storage provider and quantity of storage units.
# If no storage provider is set, PyNukez defaults to "gcs".
request = client.request_storage(units=1, provider="gcs")

# Print details for next step
print(request.next_step)
# -> "Transfer 0.001 SOL to <addr> on solana-devnet,
#     then call confirm_storage(pay_req_id='...', tx_sig=<your_tx_signature>)"

# Using the x402 payment details assigned to the request variable
# Complete transfer via preferred method
# Assign transaction signature from above transfer to variable like so:
tx_sig = "..."

# Issue receipt object by confirming payment with the Nukez Gateway
receipt = client.confirm_storage(request.pay_req_id, tx_sig=tx_sig)

# Provision storage locker instance via the receipt
client.provision_locker(receipt.id)

# Upload file. File contents do not pass through agent context window.
# Tremendous advantage over ordinary flows.
local_file = Path("~/Documents/report.pdf").expanduser()
uploaded = client.upload_file_path(
    receipt.id,
    str(local_file),
    content_type="application/pdf",
)

# Large or long-running upload option:
# job = client.start_bulk_upload_job(
#     receipt.id,
#     sources=[{"filepath": str(local_file), "content_type": "application/pdf"}],
#     workers=1,
# )
# status = client.get_upload_job(job["job_id"])

# How to read stored content back
file_urls = client.get_file_urls(receipt.id, uploaded["filename"])
data = client.download_bytes(file_urls.download_url)

# How to view/render retrieved object
downloaded_file = Path("~/Downloads/nukez_report.pdf").expanduser()
downloaded_file.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
downloaded_file.write_bytes(data)
webbrowser.open(downloaded_file.as_uri())
```

### Async version

```python
from pynukez import AsyncNukez

async with AsyncNukez(
    keypair_path="~/.config/solana/id.json",  # local Ed25519 envelope signer
) as client:
    request = await client.request_storage(units=1)
    # ... execute the transfer externally ...
    receipt = await client.confirm_storage(request.pay_req_id, tx_sig=tx_sig)
    # ... same methods as sync, just awaited
```

## Sandboxed App Uploads

Most Python users should start with `upload_file_path()`, `bulk_upload_paths()`,
or `upload_directory()`. The `sandbox_upload_*` helpers are advanced fallback
methods for MCP/provider-hosted runtimes where local path handling or direct
signed-URL uploads are restricted.

Use the convenience helpers first:

```python
from pathlib import Path

result = client.sandbox_upload_file_path(
    receipt.id,
    "/Users/alice/Downloads/image.png",
    filename="image.png",
    content_type="image/png",
)

print(result["status"])
print(result["file"]["content_hash"])
```

In notebooks, do not print large raw byte strings. Write downloads to disk or
stream them directly:

```python
file_urls = client.get_file_urls(receipt.id, "image.png")

out = Path("~/Downloads/image_roundtrip.png").expanduser()
client.download_to_file(file_urls.download_url, out)
```

For manual base64 chunk control, use the lower-level job API:

```python
job = client.sandbox_create_ingest_job(
    receipt_id=receipt.id,
    files=[{"filename": "image.png", "content_type": "image/png"}],
)

client.sandbox_append_ingest_part(
    receipt_id=receipt.id,
    job_id=job["job_id"],
    file_id=job["files"][0]["file_id"],
    part_no=0,
    payload_b64="<chunk-0-base64>",
    is_last=True,
)

result = client.sandbox_complete_ingest_job(
    receipt_id=receipt.id,
    job_id=job["job_id"],
)
```

Convenience helpers are available:
- `client.sandbox_upload_bytes(...)`
- `client.sandbox_upload_base64(...)`
- `client.sandbox_upload_file_path(...)`

Important: if a valid `receipt_id` already exists, reuse it. Do not purchase storage again unless explicitly requested.

## Receipt Handles And Recovery

Keep `receipt.id` as your primary SDK handle. It is the fastest way to
provision, upload, list, verify, attest, and delegate against a locker. It is
not the only trace of the transaction, though: because payment and attestation
state are anchored to the payer/signing context, a lost local receipt handle can
be recovered from the on-chain transaction trail for the relevant keypair.

```python
# First time
receipt = client.confirm_storage(...)
print(receipt.id)  # Persist this as the primary SDK handle.

# Later — fresh process, reconstructed client:
client.bind_receipt(receipt)          # or: bind_receipt(receipt_id=..., owner_identity=...)
files = client.list_files(receipt.id)
```

`confirm_storage()` primes per-receipt state automatically in the same
process. Across kernel restarts, subprocesses, or receipts loaded from
disk/DB, call `bind_receipt(receipt)` before owner-only ops
(`add_operator`, `remove_operator`) — on dual-key clients, the SDK
refuses to guess which signer to use and raises `ReceiptStateNotBoundError`
instead.

---

## Selecting Devnet Or Mainnet

Choose the target network explicitly when constructing the client:

```python
# Devnet (testing)
client = Nukez(keypair_path="~/.config/solana/id.json", network="devnet")

# Mainnet (production)
client = Nukez(keypair_path="~/.config/solana/id.json", network="mainnet-beta")
```

---

## Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Transaction not found" | The tx hasn't propagated yet. Wait a few seconds and retry `confirm_storage()` |
| "URL expired" | Call `client.get_file_urls(receipt_id, filename)` for fresh URLs |
| "File not found" | Check `client.list_files(receipt_id)` to see what exists |
| `ReceiptStateNotBoundError` | Call `client.bind_receipt(receipt)` before the op (cross-session / fresh-client flows) |
| `AuthenticationError: Envelope sig_alg '...' incompatible with ... network` | Dual-key client picked wrong signer — call `client.bind_receipt(receipt)` first |
