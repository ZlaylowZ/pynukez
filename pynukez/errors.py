"""
Agent-friendly error classes for Nukez SDK.

Every error includes actionable guidance for autonomous agents.
Error messages tell agents exactly how to fix problems.

Design Philosophy:
- Errors are part of the API, not just failure modes
- Each error tells the agent what to do next
- The `retryable` flag indicates if retry might help
- Details dict provides structured error information
